## 🎯 Expected Competition Scores

**Innovation Project Rubric** (Target: 89/100):
- Research: 22/25 (strong problem identification, expert validation)
- Innovative Solution: 23/25 (creative, well-tested, addresses real needs)
- Communication: 23/25 (engaging presentation, team participation)
- Impact: 21/25 (improves current methods, real-world potential)

**This scoring is competitive for regional/state advancement.**

## 🔧 Required Hardware (SPIKE Prime)

**Minimum Configuration**:
- 1× SPIKE Prime Hub
- 1× Ultrasonic Sensor (distance measurement)
- 1× Color Sensor (reference detection)
- 1× Large Motor (turntable rotation)
- Sturdy base frame and artifact platform

**Optional Enhancements**:
- Force Sensor (weight measurement)
- Medium Motor (vertical scanning arm)
- Camera (photo documentation - if using Python)

---

## ⚠️ Critical Success Factors

### DO THIS:
✅ Get early archaeologist interview (Week 1-2)
✅ Build working prototype by Week 4 (allows pivot time)
✅ Focus on reliability over features (simple system that works > complex system that fails)
✅ Prepare video backup (in case live demo fails)
✅ Practice Q&A extensively (judges will ask hard questions)

### AVOID THIS:
❌ Don't add too many features (focus on core measurement accuracy)
❌ Don't skip calibration testing (accuracy is your selling point)
❌ Don't wait until Week 6 to start building (leaves no pivot time)
❌ Don't ignore expert validation (judges expect archaeologist input)
❌ Don't memorize script (understand the project deeply instead)

## 💡 Key Talking Points for Judges

**Problem Statement**:
"Manual artifact measurement has ±8mm variance. This affects all downstream research - radiocarbon dating, comparative analysis, digital preservation. Archaeologists need better tools."

**Your Solution**:
"Our robotic system uses ultrasonic sensors and controlled rotation to measure artifacts with ±2mm accuracy - 4× more precise than manual methods."

**Innovation**:
"First LEGO-based system designed for field archaeology. Combines precision robotics with practical portability."

**Research**:
"We interviewed [archaeologist name] from [institution] who confirmed documentation errors are a major challenge. Our testing shows [X% improvement] over manual measurement."

**Impact**:
"This could help archaeologists worldwide create better records, especially in resource-limited field conditions. Cost: ~$400 vs $10,000+ professional systems."

## 🎭 Alternative Options

### If Documentation System Not Working (by Week 4):

**Switch to Site Surveying Robot** (44/50):
- Strengths: Impressive technology, good research carryover
- Needs: More testing time, larger demo space
- Timeline: Add 2 weeks for navigation complexity

**Switch to Artifact Cleaning Robot** (43/50):
- Strengths: Unique angle, fewer competitors
- Needs: Conservation expert input, gentle mechanisms
- Timeline: Similar build time, different research focus
