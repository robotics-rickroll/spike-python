## ⚡ Quick Start (Week 1-2)

If you choose the winning recommendation, start here:

### Immediate Action Items:
1. **Schedule archaeologist interview** (museum curator, university professor, or state archaeologist)
2. **Inventory SPIKE Prime set** (confirm you have: ultrasonic sensor, color sensor, large motor)
3. **Team kickoff meeting** (assign roles: research, design, build, presentation)
4. **Begin research** (search "archaeological documentation errors" and "artifact measurement methods")

### Research Questions for Expert Interview:
- What are the most common measurement errors in field documentation?
- How much time do you spend on artifact documentation?
- Would you use a robotic measurement system if available?
- What accuracy level would be useful for your work?
- What artifact types are hardest to measure accurately?

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Minimum Viable Project:
- Robot measures length, width, height of regular objects
- Accuracy within ±5mm
- Consistent demonstration (8/10 success rate)
- Basic research presentation

### Competitive Project (Target):
- Multi-angle measurement with rotation
- Accuracy within ±2mm
- Data logging and export
- Expert validation (video/letter)
- Reliable demo (10/10 success rate)

### Award-Winning Project (Stretch):
- Photo documentation integration
- Artifact ID system (QR codes)
- Statistical accuracy analysis
- Working partnership with museum/archaeologist
- Evidence of multiple design iterations

---

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

### DO NOT DO THIS:
❌ Wait until Week 6 to start building (leaves no time to pivot)
❌ Add too many features (focus on core measurement accuracy)
❌ Skip expert validation (judges expect archaeologist input)
❌ Ignore calibration testing (accuracy is your selling point)
❌ Memorize presentation script (understand deeply instead)

### DO THIS INSTEAD:
✅ Working prototype by Week 4 (allows pivot time if needed)
✅ Simple system that works reliably > complex system that fails
✅ Get archaeologist interview in Week 1-2
✅ Practice 50+ demo runs before competition
✅ Prepare video backup (in case live demo fails)

6. record_data() - Log with timestamp
7. export_results() - Display/export data
```

### Build Timeline:
- Weeks 1-2: Research + design
- Weeks 3-4: Build prototype
- Weeks 5-6: Add features + test accuracy

## 🎭 Alternative Scenarios

### If you want more challenge:
→ Choose: **Site Surveying Robot** (44/50)
→ Requires: Strong programming + 2-3 extra weeks + large testing space
→ Risk: Navigation complexity, terrain testing

### If you want unique angle:
→ Choose: **Artifact Cleaning Robot** (43/50)
→ Requires: Conservation expert input + precision mechanics
→ Benefit: Fewer competitors will choose this

### If documentation system fails by Week 4:
→ Pivot: **Site Surveying** or **Artifact Cleaning**
→ Timeline: Can switch with 1-2 week delay
→ Research carries over
